# NumberGuessingGame
This is a Number Guessing Game made with Python.

This program randomly chooses a number with a range of 0 to 100 to guess and then the user will have a few chances to guess the number correctly. In each wrong attempt, the computer will give a hint that the number is greater or smaller than the one you have guessed. By the end of the game, you will be shown with the total amount of time you played the game.
